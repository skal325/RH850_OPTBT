# RH850_OPTBT
Template for flashing option bytes in Renesas RH850

I can't remember where I got this template from. It was originally intended for RH850 E2x, but I have successfully used it to flash
RH850 U2B option bytes and it should probably work for other RH850 families as well. But check the template for compatibility.
